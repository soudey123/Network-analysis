## 1. R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## 2. Programming Assignment

    Find some network data that you think is suitable and that you would like to visualize. Here are some sites that provide links to a wide variety of different graph/network datasets:

    Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection
    UCI Network Data Repository

    Choose a visualization platform and parse the data into a format suitable for the tools you will use.
    
## 3. Environment Setup

This analysis requires to load the following R pacakages :
iGraph,dplyr,networkD3

```{r package, echo = TRUE}
suppressMessages(library('igraph'))
suppressMessages(library('dplyr'))
suppressMessages(library('networkD3'))
```

## 3. Data Collection

This particular assignment exhibits the undirected social network between 62 different Dolphine species living off in a community in New Zealand. The whole dataset has been complied by the followings:

  D. Lusseau, K. Schneider, O. J. Boisseau, P. Haase, E. Slooten, and
  S. M. Dawson, The bottlenose dolphin community of Doubtful Sound features
  a large proportion of long-lasting associations, Behavioral Ecology and
  Sociobiology 54, 396-405 (2003).
  
For data collection purpose, R code loaded the whole dataset found here : https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data/dolphins/dolphins.gml

```{r data, echo = TRUE}

dolphins <- read.graph(file='https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data/dolphins/dolphins.gml', format='gml')

```

## 4. Data Manipulation 

During this step the centrality measure has been calculated by the function "betweenness" and "closeness".

NetworkD3 package edge references to nodes start from 0 so the edge value has been adjusted here

```{r data manipulation, echo = TRUE}

dolphins_nodes <- get.data.frame(dolphins, what = 'vertices') %>% mutate(Betweenness = betweenness(dolphins), Closeness = closeness(dolphins))
dolphins_edges <- get.data.frame(dolphins, what = 'edges')

dolphins_edges$from <- dolphins_edges$from - 1
dolphins_edges$to <- dolphins_edges$to - 1

```

## 5. Data Visualization

Create an interactive network D3 graph to achieve the following purpose :

  - click-and-drag the nodes.
  - double click on any node for zooming.
  - move your cursor to the graph and scroll can zoom on whole graph.
  - see the social network among all the dolphin species.
  
  
 
  
  
```{r network, echo = TRUE}
forceNetwork(Links = dolphins_edges, Nodes = dolphins_nodes,
             Source = "from", Target ="to",
             colourScale = JS("d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory20);"),
             radiusCalculation = JS("Math.sqrt(d.nodesize)+6"),
             NodeID = "label",
             Nodesize = "id",
             Group = "id",
             linkDistance = 100,opacity = 1.0, zoom = TRUE,fontSize = 12,opacityNoHover = TRUE)

```
